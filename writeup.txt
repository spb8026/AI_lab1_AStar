For my cost function, I calculate the distance whether going horizontally, vertically, or 
diagnally as well as the difference in elevation, and divide this by the speed of the pixel to travel to to get a speed '
for traveling across that pixel.
For my speeds I chose these values:
Open Land: 5.5
Rough Meadow: 2.5
Easy Movement Forest: 5
Slow Run Forest: 4
Walk Forest: 3
Impassible Vegitation: 1
Lake/Swamp/Marsh: .2
Paved Road: 6
Footbath: 7
OB: 0
My huerstic value is the 3D distance between that pixel and the goal pixel. This encourages the algorithim to follow
paths relatilvey closer in distance to the goal.
